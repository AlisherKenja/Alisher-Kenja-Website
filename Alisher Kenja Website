			<h2>Intrest In IT</h2>
		</div>


			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						I think my interest in IT peaked with my IST teacher (Information and Software Technology Class), he is by far my favorite teacher and he is a close family friend too, he taught me everything I know about coding, making games, building websites, Graphical technology (Using AutoCad, Fusion360, Adobe) and even about this course so I like to think of him as family and I am very lucky to have him. I felt that he was the one to spark my interest in IT.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose to enter this course in RMIT because I enjoy these things, I believe that I can make this a hobby and a job while loving every part of it. I believe that technology has many advantages and it can help people like me get a headstart and do something I enjoy while making time to do other things and make a living. RMIT will help me get that head start and will help me pave the way to implementing what I like and do best into my future, It will help me as it has active teachers, and well founded resources, and I believe it has extensive questions and responses to help solve any inquiries.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my studies during this course i expect to learn what IT is and how to apply that knowledge in the real world my making either a game or a product with the help of my teacher, I expect t learn how to work collaboratively, effectively and creatively learning about my peers and teacher while learning about technological innovations.

						What do the results of these tests mean to you?
					</p>
					</p>
						This test result reimagined what I know about myself, it is reassuring knowing that I am not someone I myself don't know. I am surprised at how accurate I think this quiz is, the visuals through the well made website and well designed reference photos really add to the experience of knowing how you are that person.

					<p>
						How do you think these results may influence your behaviour on a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I feel more reassured and it helped me look at my strengths and weaknesses through a different perspective. It is a different experience having all your strengths and weaknesses written in front of you by someone else, It makes me feel more understood and it showed me how I could really make an impact on any team with my given skill sets.
					</p>
					<p>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						As a Virtuoso I can offer any team my creativity, I would help my team in any way possible, I can be flexible and a great social worker, I would offer every ounce of strength and time for a team but I sometimes need someone to put me in check as I get sidetracked easily, I would form a team of people who can cover each other's weaknesses and whom strengths we can use but anyone is welcome too.

					<p>
						What do the results of these tests mean to you?
					</p>
					<p>
						The results of this test tells me that I am a tactile learner, I enjoy learning new things by touching and doing while taking frequent breaks. The test tells me that I love physical activity and have trouble sitting still while tinkering with things. I found that this test was accurate too but while not as accurate as the other tests it told me things that the other tests didn't tell me like athletic ability.
					</p>
					<p>
						How do you think these results may influence your behaviour on a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I may be more of a hard worker while also taking many tests to break away from work and society. I will probably be away most days doing outdoor activities and staying with close friends, but I will always make time for work and keep things on task.
					</p>
					<p>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I would choose a team that can work with a person like me or join a team that can benefit from my available skillset like people who are leaders, or can spend a lot of time working while I cant but I am not too picky and I am happy to join any team as long as we all stay within good terms of each other.

						What do the results of these tests mean to you?
					</p>
					<p>
						In this test I am on the brink of unlocking my creative mind, To me this means that i would be a good team worker as i have something to give a team and to help any team and it’s team members making me a good teammate.
					</p>
					<p>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I would do my part in any team and would be a social worker, I would do my best for a team and would make sure to have fun too, although I do some difficulty concentrating I would split my time between rest and work so I can get the most done while also taking time off. I would make a team that fits together and works together while also covering each other weaknesses and working with strengths.

			<h3>Project Idea</h3>
			<h4>Overview</h4>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						The project would consist of a game on Unreal Engine which is majorly based on movement. It would be a character with advanced movement like wall jumping, a double jump, keeping your momentum through, sliding, wall climbing and kicking objects out of the way. Keep your speed and get through to the end of the level, make the wrong move you slow down and you would lose your momentum and then you have to restart. The levels would get more difficult as it goes on, there will even be targets which you have to kick down to reach the end.
					</p>
					<p>
						There may be a bonus where we can randomise it and the computer would be able to generate random possible levels for only the best at the game.

					<p>
						This game will be something you can jump into and easily understand the flow of the game while also being challenging for the best players, it will include problem solving and will require quick thinking while going around corners or you could plan your steps with provided glass windows, the game will be for everyone of all ages and will train you eyes to see details that could win you the level, it will increase your heart rate and will put your reaction time and mouse aim  to the test. These types of games will be easy to download while also giving you a mental workout and truing your aim while you challenge yourself and play for a few minutes.

These types of games will be easy to download while also giving you a mental workout and truing your aim while you challenge yourself and play for a few minutes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game will be all about movement, there will be features such as jump, double jump, wall jump, sliding, wall climb, destructible targets, moving objects, grab system all via the mouse and multiple levels. The game will feature fast paced movement where momentum is Key to reaching the end of the level, The game will provide easy, medium and hard modes with the acceleration speed lowered for each one. Example: hard will take a long time to accelerate while easy will take short time allowing that game to be played by all skill levels.
					</p>
					<p>
						The levels themselves will become harder and will require you to solve some puzzles on the fly to get through, you can solve puzzles by completing tasks in the levels, these could include: breaking targets, moving items, pulling levers or pushing buttons. These will progressively get harder and will require a faster reaction time to complete, but you can also plan it out with correctly allocated windows allowing you to see what is coming up so you can plan some of your steps ahead of time and if things don't go your way you can always try the level with an easier mode. By completing a level faster you gain coins which can be used to upgrade your jump height, jump distance, forward speed, strafe speed, longer reach, time slow etc to help you complete harder levels, you can reset this and get you points back to allocate somewhere else if you need to do so to complete a level. Example: for level 12 you may not be able to jump high enough to reach the end so you exit the level, reset your points and allocate them to jump height, then you can finish the level or with a greater skill you could complete the level without extra jump height. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiplayer adds to the experience, playing with friends is a great way to enjoy a game more, you can choose to collaborate in multiplayer maps which require more than 1 person or choose to race to the end with all your friends and silhouettes on your screen and see who can get to the end the fastest, allowing you to hone your mouse skills and reaction time while also enjoying a game you can fit to your play style with higher skill levels or more relaxed players., or compete through harder puzzle maps and see who can solve it and reach the end first, helping you sharpen your reaction time and problem solving skills.

					<p>
						We would need the Unreal Engine which is free for the program so we can enjoy the amazing graphics and add complex stuff like lights, reflections and shading. We would probably need help from the teacher to achieve some of the listed features. Design apps like blender to create the textures, animations and to make the visuals generally better allowing for a better experience while playing the game.

			<h3>Project Idea</h3>
			<h4>Skills Required</h4>
		</div>


			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						You would require skills and knowledge in game making and coding while also needing to know how to operate the unreal engine, game design and teamwork would be a mandatory skill as the levels would need to flow and would require all people to do their part so we can accomplish this. Having a good understanding physics would be a great bonus so we can simulate the destructible objects and moving part effectively and realistically so people would enjoy the game, It may be hard to accomplish and may require an extra early start but it will be a great experience and will teach everyone valuable skills and I believe we can still execute this and get it how we want it.

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						People will have a much more toned reaction time, and problem solving skills,, people would either hone in on their quick thinking skills or take their time and plan every step out giving people a mental workout while also trueing people’s aim through the complex movement and increasing the skill of players while reducing the skill gap that other games tend to have. I think this is important as it is good for you mind tou face a challenge so why not make it a fun challege and make it into a g.
